This is a COOPERATIVE OPERATING SYSTEM used in small systems and
low power micro-controllers, where context switching is too heavy
to handle.

Originally developed for ~1MHz, low-power, low electromagnetic noise
systems.

This is architecturized as subsets of finite state machines.

Tasks are cyclic and they should not do busy-waiting loops, or heavy
cpu loading work.

Still developing..
