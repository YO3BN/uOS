- produce / consume systicks, start failsafe context-switch kernel superviser

- tid different of idx
- event subscribe for multiple modules/tasks
- implement archint type (fast integer)
- think about io,ipc,sem,sched be separate modules dynamically inserted in kconsume_events??

- some kernel work events cannot be conumed immediately? they have to remain stored in queue??
- statistics idle time, load, uptime etc?
- task timer - waiting timer - have to implement semapahores before.
- task state IPC_WAIT?
